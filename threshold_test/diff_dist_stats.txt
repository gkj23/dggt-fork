=== Dynamic mask 点云 diff/dist 统计（用于设定 threshold / temperature）===

坐标系来源（代码中无显式标注）：
  - time_varient_pts: point_head(aggregated_tokens_list)，聚合多帧，渲染时作 world 使用。
  - time_invarient_pts: point_head(decoded_tokens_list)，decoder 按帧 condition，设计上亦为 world。
  若 dist 统计与预期不符，可加 --unify_frame 0 在「统一到第 0 帧相机系」后重算 dist 对比。

样本数: 50, 总有效像素数: 145040000

--- 建议 ---
  get_dynamic_mask(threshold=...) 可参考 dist 的百分位数：
  - 若希望少标 dynamic：threshold 取大一些（如 p95 或 p99 附近）。
  - 若希望多标 dynamic：threshold 取小一些（如 p50 或 p75 附近）。
  temperature 控制 sigmoid 在 threshold 附近的陡峭程度，可先用 0.01~0.02 试。
